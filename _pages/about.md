<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

I am currently a third-year Ph.D. candidate at Peking University, advised by Professor Yibo Lin. Previously, I obtained my Master's degree in 2022 from the University of Chinese Academy of Sciences (UCAS), where I was co-advised by Professors Shifeng Chen, Chao Dong, and Yu Qiao. My research focuses on AI-driven methodologies for physical design automation.
